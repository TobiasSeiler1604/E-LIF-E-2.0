## 📝 Analysis

**Problem**
💡 In a busy lifestyle, individuals often lack a simple, consolidated way to track and assess their daily wellness habits (e.g., sleep, stress, water, exercise). This lack of immediate feedback makes it difficult to maintain awareness, identify patterns, and make necessary adjustments to achieve their health and habit goals. 

**Scenario**
💡 The E-lif(e) Tracker is designed for quick, end-of-day use. The user runs the application from the console, is prompted with quick questions about their day’s habits, and, upon completion, automatically generates a clear status report with a personalized wellness score and actionable advice. This provides an immediate, clear overview without complex setup or extensive data entry. 1 User will log her/his daily data’s into the program. 

**User stories:**
1. As a User, I want to track my daily habits by answering simple, quick questions in order to stay strong and healthy. 
2. As a User, I want to quickly add information about my lifestyle (nutrition, sport, sleep) in order to get decisive and valuable information for improvement. 
3. As a User, I want to receive a daily status report that gives personalized advice based on my input in order to keep me motivated. 
4. As a User, I want the history of my daily reports to be saved so I can view my progress over time in order to track my improvement and development. 

**Use cases:**
1. Enter daily wellness data (sleep, stress, exercise, etc.) 
2. Validate each entry to prevent invalid input
3. Save all inputs to a file (e.g., ‘weekly_data.txt’). Saving inputs for 28 days 
4. Generate a weekly status report (‘report.txt’) with advice and summaries

## ✅ Project Requirements

Each app must meet the following three criteria in order to be accepted (see also the official project guidelines PDF on Moodle):

1. Interactive app (console input)
2. Data validation (input checking)
3. File processing (read/write)

---

### 1. Interactive App (Console Input)

---
The application interacts with the user via the console. Users can:
- View all the habits 
- Select habit and answer the question 
- See the results of each habit - Receive a daily/weekly overview of the habits

---


### 2. Data Validation 

To ensure the application collects accurate and meaningful information, every user input is validated before it is stored or used for calculations. The program uses predefined categories, data types, and validation rules to prevent invalid values and keep the dataset consistent.

All validation is implemented directly in main.py, mainly through the helper functions ask_choice() and ask_number(). These functions repeatedly prompt the user until valid input is provided.

**Sleep quality validation:**
```python
Category: Sleep rating
Data type: String (input) → mapped to Integer (stored)
Validation rule: Must be one of: good, medium, bad
Storage: sleep is saved as a numeric score using SLEEP_MAP


	def ask_choice(prompt, mapping):
    while True:
        value = input(prompt).lower().strip()
        if value in mapping:
            return mapping[value]
        print("Invalid input.")

Example usage:

	day["sleep"] = ask_choice("Sleep (good/medium/bad): ", SLEEP_MAP)
```

**Stress level validation:**

```python
When the user enters their daily stress level, the program ensures that the input is a number between 1 and 5:
Category: Daily stress measurement (1–5)
Data type: Integer
Validation rule: Must be an integer between 1 and 5

	
	def ask_number(prompt, min_val=None, max_val=None, is_float=False):
    while True:
        try:
            value = float(input(prompt)) if is_float else int(input(prompt))
            if (min_val is None or value >= min_val) and \
               (max_val is None or value <= max_val):
                return value
        except:
            pass
        print("Invalid input.")

Example usage:

	day["stress"] = ask_number("Stress (1-5): ", 1, 5)
```

- **Yes/No questions (friends, exercise, hobbies, medication):** 

```python
For binary inputs, the program checks if the user enters only yes or no:
Category: Social & health habits (friends, exercise, hobbies, meds)
Data type: String (input) → mapped to Integer (stored)
Validation rule: Must be yes or no
Storage: Stored as numeric values using YES_NO_MAP

day["exercise"] = ask_choice("Exercise? (yes/no): ", YES_NO_MAP)
day["friends"] = ask_choice("Hung out with friends? (yes/no): ", YES_NO_MAP)
```

- **Water intake validation:** 

```python
Water intake is checked to confirm that the input is numeric and within realistic limits:
Category: Daily water consumption (liters)
Data type: Float (input) → categorized to Integer (stored)
Validation rule: Must be a non-negative number
Storage rule: liters are categorized into 3 levels

	def classify_water():
    w = ask_number("Water (liters): ", 0, None, True)
    return 1 if w < 1 else 2 if w <= 1.5 else 3
```

- **Step count validation:**

```python
The number of steps is verified to be a positive integer:
Category: Physical activity measurement
Data type: Integer (input) → categorized to Integer (stored)
Validation rule: Must be a non-negative integer
Storage rule: categorized into 3 levels

	def classify_steps():
    s = ask_number("Steps: ", 0)
    return 1 if s < 4000 else 2 if s < 10000 else 3
```

**Date Validation (Optional Change):**

```python
After input collection, users can manually overwrite the automatically generated date. The entered date must match the format YYYY/MM/DD.

	new = input("Enter date (yyyy/mm/dd): ").strip()
	datetime.datetime.strptime(new, "%Y/%m/%d")
```

These validation checks ensure that:

- the program does not crash due to invalid input,
- stored data remains consistent across days,
- summaries and score calculations remain reliable.


### 3. File Processing 

The application uses JSON files for persistent storage and reporting.

- **Input file/ Storage File:** 

File name: girlypop_data.json
Purpose: Stores all logged days
Format: A list of dictionaries (one dictionary per day)

Each entry contains standardized numeric values for all tracked metrics plus the computed total score.

Example structure:

	```json
				[
  {
    "date": "2025/12/13",
    "sleep": 3,
    "stress": 2,
    "friends": 2,
    "water": 2,
    "exercise": 1,
    "mood": 3,
    "work_hours": 8.0,
    "hobbies": 2,
    "steps": 2,
    "meds": 2,
    "score": 22
  }
]
```
- The application reads this file to generate a weekly or monthly summary and give personalized advice.
- Loading and saving: the file (example implementation):

	```python
	def load_data():
    return json.load(open(DATA_FILE)) if os.path.exists(DATA_FILE) else []

	def save_data(data):
    json.dump(data, open(DATA_FILE, "w"), indent=4)


- **Output file(Monthly/Weekly Reports):** 
When the user selects “Generate monthly report”, the program creates two files:

1. JSON report file
Filename format: monthly_report_YYYY_MM.json
Contains: month/year, days logged, total score, average score, and averages per metric.

2. TXT report file
Filename format: monthly_report_YYYY_MM.txt
Human-readable summary including the same key statistics.

Writing output:

	```python
		json_name = f"monthly_report_{today.year}_{today.month:02d}.json"
		json.dump(report, open(json_name, "w"), indent=4)

		txt_name = f"monthly_report_{today.year}_{today.month:02d}.txt"
		with open(txt_name, "w") as f:
		```

2. Open the **Terminal**
3. Run:
	```bash
	python3 main.py
	```

### Libraries Used

- `os`: Check if files exist and handle paths.
- `datetime` → Add timestamps or weekly summaries.
- `json`: Used for data storage

### Project Modules
- `from menu import`: main_menu

All external dependencies used in this project come from Python’s standard library, so no additional installation is required. In addition, the project uses custom modules created within the codebase (e.g. for menu handling) to improve structure and readability. These components were chosen for their simplicity and effectiveness in managing data, files, and user interaction in a console application.

**Highlight: Data Validation & Storage Design**

One major highlight of our project was the structured validation and storage of user input.
Initially, user inputs were entered as strings (e.g. good, medium, bad). By introducing mapping dictionaries that convert these string inputs into numeric values, we were able to standardize the data and evaluate it numerically.

This approach enabled a clear and consistent scoring system, simplified calculations, and reduced repetitive conditional logic. As a result, the overall code became shorter, more readable, and easier to maintain.

**Problems**
1. Project Management & Time Management

One of the main challenges of the project was project management, particularly task distribution and time management. During the first phase of the project, progress was slower than expected, and for several weeks no concrete implementation or clear technical approach had been defined. This was partly due to uncertainty about how to translate the lecture content, which was taught step by step, into a complete and independent project.

As a result, a significant portion of the development work had to be completed closer to the submission deadline. This required increased coordination, parallel work, and fast decision-making within the team.

Through this experience, the team learned the importance of:

- defining a clear project structure early on,
- assigning responsibilities at an earlier stage,
- and aligning implementation steps more closely with lecture progress.

Despite these challenges, the team successfully reorganized tasks, focused on core functionality, and delivered a working and well-structured application.

2. Limitations

Due to the late start of the implementation phase and limited remaining time before submission, it was not possible to go into greater technical depth in all parts of the code. While the core functionality, validation, and data storage were implemented successfully, some areas could not be refined as thoroughly as initially intended.

- As a result, the project’s limitations mainly concern:
- limited time for deeper refactoring and optimization,
- fewer edge-case tests and extended error handling, reduced opportunity to explore more advanced features introduced later in the lectures.

These limitations are primarily related to time and project management constraints rather than conceptual or technical understanding. Given more time, the project could be extended with cleaner abstractions, additional tests, and more advanced logic.

2. 1 **Limitations in our current code**

**Code Structure & Maintainability**

1) Missing return value in classify_steps()
The classify_steps() function does not return a value, which causes the steps field to be stored as None. This affects the wellness score calculation as well as weekly and monthly averages.

    ´´´python
        def classify_steps():
        s = ask_number("Steps: ", 0, 50000)
´´´ 
Since no value is returned, steps becomes None, which affects scoring and averages.

Improvement idea:

´´´python
       def classify_steps():
    s = ask_number("Steps: ", 0, 50000)
    return 1 if s < 5000 else 2 if s < 10000 else 3

´´´ 

2) Duplicate function definitions
The functions to_number() and process_day() are defined twice in the same file. This duplication increases maintenance effort and creates the risk of inconsistencies if only one version is modified.

´´´python
       def to_number(val):
    ...

´´´ 
The same function appears twice in the file, increasing maintenance risk.

Improvement idea:
Move shared logic into a dedicated module (e.g. scoring.py) and import it once.

3) No enforced 28-day data limit
Although comments indicate a 28-day history, the application currently stores all entries indefinitely. Older data is never trimmed, which can distort long-term reporting and increase file size.

´´´python
       data.append(processed)
save_data(data)

´´´ 

All historical entries are saved without trimming.

Improvement idea:

´´´python
      data.append(processed)
data = data[-28:]
save_data(data)
 
´´´ 

4) Unsafe and non-robust file handling
JSON files are opened without context managers, and no error handling is implemented for corrupted or empty files. If a file becomes invalid, the program will crash.

´´´python
     json.load(open(DATA_FILE))
  
´´´ 

Files are opened without context managers or error handling.

Improvement idea:
´´´python
       try:
    with open(DATA_FILE, "r") as f:
        return json.load(f)
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
    return []

´´´ 

5) Inconsistent use of data storage formats
Daily entries are written to both JSON and a TXT weekly log, but weekly reports are generated only from the JSON file. The TXT log is not used for reporting and lacks a clear functional role.


       week_data = data[-7:]


This selects the last seven entries, not the last seven days.

Improvement idea:

       from datetime import datetime, timedelta

today = datetime.now()
week_data = [
    d for d in data
    if datetime.strptime(d["date"], "%Y/%m/%d") >= today - timedelta(days=7)
]



6) Weekly report does not reflect a real calendar week
The weekly report is based on the last seven logged entries rather than the last seven calendar days. If users skip days, the report may span more than one week, and missing days are not detected.

´´´python
       
´´´ 

7) Incomplete integration of collected metrics into scoring
Some validated inputs, such as work_hours, are collected and reported but do not contribute to the wellness score, which makes tracking feel incomplete.

´´´python
       
´´´ 

8) Numeric averages are not intuitive for users
Yes/No values are stored as numeric values (1 or 2), leading to averages such as 1.6. While mathematically correct, these results are difficult to interpret.

´´´python
       
´´´ 

9) Monthly report is not truly monthly
The monthly report aggregates all stored data, even when entries span multiple months, reducing the accuracy of monthly insights.

´´´python
       
´´´ 

10) Minor edge case in numeric validation messages
Range error messages in ask_number() are not displayed correctly when the minimum value is 0 due to truthy checks.

11) No protection against duplicate date entries
Users can manually enter dates that already exist in the dataset, resulting in duplicate or conflicting records for the same day.

12) Overly simplified scoring categories
Some metrics, such as water intake and steps, are reduced to broad categories. While this simplifies scoring, it limits the ability to track gradual improvements.

13) Hard-coded limits may not suit all users
Fixed upper limits for work hours, steps, and water intake may not reflect all lifestyles, such as athletes or night-shift workers.

14) Lack of privacy and security measures
All data is stored in plain JSON and TXT files without encryption or access control, which raises privacy concerns.

15) Advice is rule-based rather than trend-based
Feedback is generated from single-day thresholds and does not account for longer-term behavioral patterns.

16) Dependency on an external menu module
The application depends on an external menu.py file. If this module is missing or altered, the program will not run correctly, reducing portability.




2. 3 What I’d consider doing next (Future improvements)

If you need a strong “what we would do with more time” list:

1) Fix and complete step classification
We would ensure that classify_steps() returns meaningful values and that all collected fields are consistently numeric as expected.

2) Refactor the code into modular components
We would remove duplicated functions and split the application into clearly defined modules (e.g. storage, validation, scoring, reporting) to improve maintainability.

´´´python
       
´´´ 

3) Implement true time-based data filtering
We would enforce a strict 28-day data window and generate weekly and monthly reports based on actual calendar dates rather than entry counts.

4) Expand testing and error handling
We would add systematic tests for edge cases such as corrupted or empty JSON files, invalid input, and missing data fields.

´´´python
       
´´´ 

5) Improve report clarity and user understanding
We would translate numeric averages back into meaningful labels and present summaries in a more user-friendly way.

6) Make the scoring system transparent
We would clearly explain how each metric contributes to the daily wellness score so users can understand the results.

´´´python
       
´´´ 

7) Prevent duplicate date entries
We would enforce one entry per calendar date by updating existing records instead of creating duplicates.

8) Enforce a maximum history length
We would automatically limit stored data to a defined number of days (e.g. 28 or 30 days) to keep reports accurate and efficient.

9) Improve weekly report accuracy
We would base weekly reports on the last seven calendar days and optionally highlight missing days.

10) Add robust data-loading safeguards
We would extend load_data() with proper exception handling to allow graceful recovery from file errors.

11) Introduce trend-based insights
We would analyze patterns over time, such as changes in stress levels, to provide more personalized and meaningful feedback.
